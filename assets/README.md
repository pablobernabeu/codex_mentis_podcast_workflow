# Assets Directory

This directory should contain your podcast logo.

## Required File

**podcast_logo.jpeg** - Your podcast logo

### Logo Requirements:

- **File name**: Must be exactly `podcast_logo.jpeg`
- **Format**: JPG or PNG (if PNG, rename to .jpg)
- **Size**: Recommended 500x500 pixels or larger
- **Shape**: Square format works best (will be made circular automatically)
- **Quality**: High resolution for best results

### Color Considerations:

Since your logo is dark blue, the waveform visualization uses elegant beige colors that will complement it beautifully.

### Logo Animation:

The logo will have a subtle "breathing" animation effect - a gentle scale animation that adds life to your video without being distracting.

### Placement Instructions:

1. Save your logo as `podcast_logo.jpeg`
2. Place it directly in this `assets/` directory
3. The path should be: `assets/podcast_logo.jpeg`

The converter will automatically:

- Resize the logo appropriately
- Apply a circular mask
- Add a subtle glow effect
- Animate it with the breathing effect
