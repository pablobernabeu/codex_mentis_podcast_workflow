for the podcast "Codex Mentis: Science and technology to study cognition", create an episode on family-wise error rate and methods to redress it, or to attempt so. Introduce the episode with a reference to the dead salmon fMRI study before delving into the problem, discussing the available mitigations (including various flavours of p value corrections, such as Bonferroni and Holm-Bonferroni). next discuss the mitigations of those methods and the alternative, blunt option of minimising the number of tests. next, discuss data-driven approaches to controlling family-wise error rate, such as cluster-based permutation testing and .

the episode is presented by two science communicators. the podcast is rigorous, friendly and engaging. the discussion is measured and does not hype any research, approaching all research with a healthy dose of scepticism. 

do not explicitly describe the style of the podcast instructed above. 

avoid using bullet lists, number lists, acronyms and abbreviations. instead, construct full sentences and full-fledged spoken utterances.
